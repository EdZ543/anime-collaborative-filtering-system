# anime-collaborative-filtering-system

A Pytorch model that suggests similar anime using collaborative filtering and deep learning.
You can try it at [this Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/EdZ123/anime-collaborative-filtering-system).

# Implementation Details
* Trained with [anime-collaborative-filtering-system.ipynb](anime-collaborative-filtering-system.ipynb) on Kaggle
* Model uses collaborative filtering with embeddings fed through a multilayer perceptron
* Recommendations are made through embedding distance
